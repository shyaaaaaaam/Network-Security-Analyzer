# Network Security Analyzer

## Overview

Network Security Analyzer is a Java-based tool designed to detect and prevent common network attacks, including ARP Spoofing, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. The tool employs advanced techniques such as SYN and ACK packet analysis to identify malicious activities and block communication from suspicious IP addresses.

## Features

- **ARP Spoofing Detection:** Protect against ARP Spoofing attacks by monitoring and validating ARP communications.

- **MITM Attack Prevention:** Identify and prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks by analyzing network traffic for unusual patterns.

- **DDoS and DoS Protection:** Utilize SYN and ACK packet analysis to detect and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

- **Dynamic IP Blocking:** Automatically block communication from IP addresses confirmed to be engaging in malicious activities.
